Maximum intensity projection (MIP) image shows an FDG-avid primary lung tumor on the left side (arrow, A) and a focus of FDG uptake in the mediastinum (arrowhead, A). CT scan shows enhancing, spiculated primary tumor (arrow, B) and a small right paratracheal node (arrowhead, B) which is negative by size criteria. Fused PET/CT image shows FDG concentration in the primary (arrow, C) as well as the node (arrowhead, C), suggesting metastatic involvement. Mediastinoscopy and biospy revealed metastatic node-N3 disease", "FDG PET in nodal disease false-positive study. Maximum intensity projection (MIP) image shows an FDG-avid primary lung tumor on the right side (arrow, A) and multiple foci of FDG uptake in the mediastinum (arrowhead, A).

Bilateral pleural effusions-M1a (arrow, A), lung metastases-M1a (arrows, B), adrenal metastasis-M1b (arrow, C), vertebral metastasis-M1b (arrow, D), brain metastasis-M1b (arrow, E), liver metastases-M1b (arrows, F)", "Adrenal adenoma versus metastasis. Enhancing solid adrenal nodule on CT scan in a case of lung cancer (arrow, A) suggestive of metastatic deposit. Unenhanced CT scan shows fatty attenuation within the nodule with an HU value of 0 suggesting the possibility of an adenoma (arrow, B). FDG PET/CT shows no tracer concentration in the nodule, confirming the diagnosis of adenoma. Enhancing solid adrenal nodule on CT scan in another patient of lung cancer (arrow, D), which is indeterminate in nature. FDG PET/CT shows abnormal focal tracer concentration in the nodule (arrow, E) highly suggestive of a metastatic deposit", "Brain metastases in asymptomatic patient, CT scan versus MRI. MRI brain in a patient of lung cancer shows multiple tiny enhancing foci scattered in the parenchyma bilaterally (arrows in A and B) suggestive of metastatic lesions. Corresponding contrast CT scan sections of the brain show no obvious lesions (C and D). Note the beam hardening effects due to bone, leading to a loss of resolution on the CT images (C and D)", "Asymptomatic marrow metastases detected on FDG PET/CT. MIP image of an FDG PET scan of a lung cancer patient shows intense tracer concentration in a mass lesion in the left hemithorax (arrows in A and B) and another smaller lesion in the right hemithorax (arrowhead, B). Intense tracer concentration is seen on FDG PET/CT in the right second rib suggesting metastatic disease (arrowhead, C).

Enhancing lung masses seen on CT scans in two different patients (arrows in A and C) with minimal pleural effusions (arrowheads in A and C). Corresponding PET/CT scans show intense FDG-avid metastatic pleural deposits (arrowheads in B and D) as the cause of effusions.

MIP image of FDG PET scan shows intense tracer concentration in the right hemithorax (arrow, A) corresponding to a right lung mass (arrow, B). Also seen are two FDG-avid foci in the abdomen (arrowheads, A) which correspond to peritoneal metastatic deposits (arrowhead, C). Note that the peritoneal deposit is almost indistinguishable from adjacent bowel (arrowhead, D). Due to PET/CT findings, the intent of treatment changes from curative surgery of a resectable mass to palliative chemotherapy", "Superior sulcus tumor. Axial (A) and coronal (B) CT scans show a large mass in the apex of the right lung causing destruction of the first and second ribs (arrows) with erosion of the right half of the vertebral body (arrowheads) suggestive of a superior sulcus tumor", "Small cell lung cancer (limited stage). MIP image of an FDG PET study shows intense tracer concentration in the mediastinum (arrow, A) which corresponds to an FDG-avid soft tissue mass on CT and PET/CT (arrow in B and C) which extends into the mediastinum and appears to conglomerate and merge with the nodal disease (arrowheads, B).
